# RequestAdmin

This powershell module is inteneded to help you request amdinistrative rights
when necessary when using windows powershell.

In the future, I want to improve it to behave more like sudo on linux, but
for now it just creates a new shell.

Additionally, I've pulled in a great little script from Piotr Stapp that
emulates sudo to a degree. For more details, see his blog post 
[here](https://stapp.space/sudo-under-windows/).
